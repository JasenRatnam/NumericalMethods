n is the number of points we want to evaluate after IVs

if used with a single ODE:
    must be used with f initialized before call with f = @(t, y) ... 
    with divisions/multiplications/powers of y (.* ./ .^)

if used in a system:
    must be used with z initialized before call as an array of functions
    with divisions/multiplications/powers of y (.* ./ .^) as follows:

    z = @(t, y) [..., ..., ...];

    variables y1, y2, ... are written as y(1), y(2), ...

    y0 must be initialized as an array containing the IVs in order
